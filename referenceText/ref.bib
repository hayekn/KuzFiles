	abstract = {Breathing can be classified into metabolic and behavioral categories. Metabolic breathing and voluntary behavioral breathing are controlled in the brainstem and in the cerebral motor cortex, respectively. This chapter places special emphasis on the reciprocal influences between breathing and emotional processes. As is the case with neural control of breathing, emotions are generated by multiple control networks, located primarily in the forebrain. For several decades, a respiratory rhythm generator has been investigated in the limbic system. The amygdala receives respiratory-related input from the piriform cortex. Excitatory recurrent branches are located in the piriform cortex and have tight reciprocal synaptic connections, which produce periodic oscillations, similar to those recorded in the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep. The relationship between olfactory breathing rhythm and emotion is seen as the gateway to interpreting the relationship between breathing and emotion. In this chapter, we describe roles of breathing in the genesis of emotion, neural structures common to breathing and emotion, and mutual importance of breathing and emotion. We also describe the central roles of conscious awareness and voluntary control of breathing, as effective methods for stabilizing attention and the contents in the stream of consciousness. Voluntary control of breathing is seen as an essential practice for achieving emotional well-being.}

	abstract = {Prenatal opioid exposure (POE) has shown to be a risk factor for adverse long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes in offspring. However, the neural mechanisms of these outcomes remain poorly understood. While preclinical and human studies suggest that these outcomes may be due to opioid-mediated changes in the fetal and early postnatal brain, other maternal, social, and environmental factors are also shown to play a role. Recent neuroimaging studies reveal brain alterations in children with POE. Early neuroimaging and novel methodology could provide an in vivo mechanistic understanding of opioid mediated alterations in developing brain. However, this is an area of ongoing research. In this review we explore recent imaging developments in POE, with emphasis on the neonatal and infant brain, and highlight some of the challenges of imaging the developing brain in this population. We also highlight evidence from animal models and imaging in older children and youth to understand areas where future research may be targeted in infants with POE.}

	author = {Nasir H. Naqvi and Antoine Bechara},
	abstract = {Most prior research on the neurobiology of addiction has focused on the role of subcortical systems, such as the amygdala, the ventral striatum and mesolimbic dopamine system, in promoting the motivation to seek drugs. Recent evidence indicates that a largely overlooked structure, the insula, plays a crucial part in conscious urges to take drugs. The insula has been highlighted as a region that integrates interoceptive (i.e. bodily) states into conscious feelings and into decision-making processes that involve uncertain risk and reward. Here, we propose a model in which the processing of the interoceptive effects of drug use by the insula contributes to conscious drug urges and to decision-making processes that precipitate relapse.}
